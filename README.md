# Virtual_File_System

Using more than 10 VFS (Virtual File System) system calls I have created a menu based filing
system in which a user can manage his or her files using VFS system calls i.e. open(), create(),
stat(), write(), read(), lseek(), chmod() and etc.
<br />
<br />
The following is the menu of my program:
<br />
+ Select file from directory
+ Create file
+ Open Selected file
+ Read File
+ Write File
+ Append File
+ Seek to read a file
+ Seek to write a file
+ Set file attributes
+ Get file attributes
+ Rename
+ Delete
